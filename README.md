## What is this?

This is the repository for the first alpha-blog of the Complete Ruby On Rails Development Course.

## This is for a course?
Yes! This course is available on [Udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/).
This is an awesome online course for those looking to learn [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and is taught by [Rob Percivel](https://www.udemy.com/user/robpercival/) and [Mashrur Hossain](https://www.udemy.com/user/mashrurhossain/).

This is the start of one of the applications you build while taking the course. It is a _Work In Progress_!
